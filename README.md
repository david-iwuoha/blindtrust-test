BlindTrust Project Documentation

Project Name: BlindTrust
Project Type: Accessible banking application (Demo / Proof-of-Concept)
Primary Technologies: Python (FastAPI), Flutter, SQLite, Yarn GPT, Whisper STT, TTS, FFmpeg

1. Project Overview

BlindTrust is a fully accessible, modular demo banking platform specifically designed for visually impaired users. The platform simulates essential banking operations (account management, transfers, profile customization) in a safe, controlled, non-monetary environment.

Key Goals

Accessibility-First: Primary focus on audio-based navigation (STT/TTS) and a highly simplified, accessible UI.

Modular Architecture: Components (Backend, Frontend, AI) can be easily replaced or upgraded to production-ready systems.

Deterministic Demo: All transactions are simulated and follow predictable, deterministic rules.

Multilingual Support: Users can interact with the system in various languages via Yarn GPT's Natural Language Understanding (NLU).

2. Team Roles

Role

Responsibilities

Backend Developer

API, DB schema, business logic, STT/TTS integration, secure demo environment setup.

Frontend Developer

Flutter mobile application, screen layouts, audio interactions, accessibility UX implementation.

UI/UX Designer

Screen designs, wireframes, and user testing specifically focused on accessibility guidelines.

3. Architecture

BlindTrust utilizes a decoupled, three-tier architecture that integrates specialized AI modules for voice accessibility.

Database

SQLite

Local storage for Users, Accounts, Transactions, and Beneficiaries demo data.

4. Key Features

4.1. Core Functionalities

Account Creation: Default balance of 10,000 units. Includes simulated biometric fallback and primary language selection.

Transfers: Simulated transfers between demo users. Implements atomic transaction logic and an Undo functionality.

Beneficiaries: Ability to add, remove, and validate simulated linked accounts.

Accessibility: Comprehensive audio-based navigation and interactions with flexible language support.

4.2. Demo / Safety Features

No Real Money: All balances and transactions are strictly simulated for safety.

Deterministic Rules: The backend enforces predictable rules to maintain consistency within the demo environment.

6. API Endpoints (FastAPI)

All endpoints are built to be called based on the structured commands generated by the Yarn GPT NLU module.

Endpoint

Method

Description

/signup

POST

Register a new demo user.

/login

POST

Authenticate and start a user session.

/account/balance

GET

Retrieve the user's current account balance.

/users/search

GET

Search for other demo users/beneficiaries.

/beneficiaries

GET/POST/DELETE

CRUD operations for beneficiary accounts.

/transfer

POST

Execute a demo money transfer.

/undo

POST

Reverse the last transaction executed.

7. AI / STT / TTS Implementation

Module

Technology

Role

STT (Speech-to-Text)

Whisper (Tiny/Small)

Converts user voice commands (wav/mp3/m4a) into actionable text.

NLU

Yarn GPT

Interprets the STT text and maps the intent (e.g., Transfer) to the correct API endpoint (/transfer).

TTS (Text-to-Speech)

Custom Integration

Converts system responses, balance details, and notifications back into audio for the user.

8. Deployment & Running

Backend Setup

To run the Python FastAPI server:

# 1. Install necessary libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Set the PYTHONPATH environment variable
export PYTHONPATH="$PWD"

# 3. Start the server (runs on [http://0.0.0.0:8000](http://0.0.0.0:8000))
uvicorn backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload


Frontend Setup

Open the Flutter project directory in your preferred IDE (e.g., VS Code or Android Studio).

Select a target device/emulator.

Run the application (flutter run).

Verify the Flutter app is configured to point to the backend URL (http://0.0.0.0:8000).

Testing STT Module in Isolation

# Ensure environment is set
export PYTHONPATH="$PWD"

# Run the test script. 
# You can modify the script to test different audio files and languages.
python backend/tests/test_stt_run.py 
# Example language options: "en", "yo", "ha"


9. Future Plans & Notes

Upgrade AI Models: Replace Whisper Tiny/Small with larger, more accurate models for production quality transcription.

Database Scalability: Migrate from SQLite to a robust, production-ready database system (e.g., PostgreSQL or MongoDB).

Security Focus: Implement full, secure backend authentication and fine-grained authorization for real-world user scenarios.

UI/UX Refinement: Continuous testing and improvement for advanced accessibility features.

Personalized Assistance: Integrate deeper AI-driven personalized financial guidance.
